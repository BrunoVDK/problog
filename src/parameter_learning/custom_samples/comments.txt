This directory holds files used to compare ProbLog to our own algorithm.
The results of running for a maximum of 1000 iterations on 1000 examples were the same.
These were custom examples generated as follows :

-------------

To generate samples, jump to this directory and do :

	problog sample tosample.pl --as-evidence -n 1000 > examples.pl

Where 100 is the specified number of samples.

The model used for the test was the same as the provided base program where the parameters were specified as follows :

0.1::friends(a,b).
0.5::friends(a,c).
0.1::friends(b,a).
0.3::friends(b,c).
0.5::friends(c,a).
0.3::friends(c,b).
