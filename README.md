Solutions for some [assignment](/assignment/assignment.pdf) on probabilistic programs (using `ProbLog` in particular).

*"ProbLog is a tool that allows you to intuitively build programs that do not only encode complex interactions between a large sets of heterogenous components but also the inherent uncertainties that are present in real-life situations."*
