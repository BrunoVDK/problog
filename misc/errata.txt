Problems in tutorial :

Semantics of rules : "suppose the following annotated disjunction" and "without a body as follows" have no formula.
Higher-order functions has no examples
Inhibition effects "this is can be achieved" and weird "None" example, "for a noisy-or gate" is not followed by example, "either p1 or p2" neither, ... (none of the examples are shown)
